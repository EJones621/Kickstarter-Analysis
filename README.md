# Ethan's kickstarter-analysis for Module 1
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
###### Conclusion #1
The summer time is when the theater outcomes are more successful, but at the same time having the most failed.
###### Conclusion #2
The 3rd most failed month was October (when the other two were in the summer) and October isn't at the top of most successful months. Typically, the highs for success and failure are within the same months. So why do failures spike back in October after the highs in July and August?
## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The higher the goal, the more likely it is to not meet it, as well as cancelation.
## What are some limitations of this dataset?
What other factors may have prevented this data to skew a bit. One that comes to mind in this day in age is a pandemic. 
## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Breaking it down based on genre.
